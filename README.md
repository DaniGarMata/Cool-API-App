1. The first screen displays at the top the game title followed by a photo of a random dinosaur (which can change when returning to that screen later). Then, a button with the title "Start" is presented.

2. This screen features 4 buttons: one to return to the title screen, and 3 others with the titles "Triassic," "Jurassic," and "Cretaceous." Pressing them takes you to a list of dinosaurs from the corresponding era.

3. This screen shows the title of the selected period from the previous screen and an arrow to return to it. Following this, there are parameters to filter the search (based on caracter√≠stics from each Dinosaur like Alphabetic order, diet, weight, etc), and then various profiles with the name and a small photo of the respective dinosaur.

4. This screen displays the title "Dino Info" and an arrow to return to the previous screen. Below is the "common" name of the dinosaur, and underneath, in smaller italicized text, is its scientific name. This is followed by an illustration/photo and a text description, along with its diet, the place of the first fossil discovery, the era to which it belongs, height, and weight. Pressing the image brings you to screen number 5.

5. This screen presents the title "Image" and an arrow to return to the previous screen. It shows a photo/illustration of the dinosaur in question with its "common" name above and the scientific name below in italics.

6. This screen features the title "Era Info" with an arrow to return to the previous screen. Following this, you see the name of the selected era alongside an illustration/photo of it. Next, the duration of the era is written (indicating the approximate start and end time), followed by a brief description of the era.
